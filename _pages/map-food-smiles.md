## 🌍 Map, Food, Smiles
- #### I’ve spent most of my life in Banqiao, Taipei, and also went to Banqiao Senior High School, which was very close to my home. For my undergraduate studies, I majored in Applied Mathematics at National Cheng Chi University (NCCU), and now I'm a master's student in finance at NYCU.

- #### When it comes to food, I love all kinds of desserts and drinks! I also enjoy hot pot and all different types of noodles.

- #### As for the things that make me happy, I love going out and spending time with friends and family. In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, working out, and other sports. But most importantly, my puppy, Chocolate, brings me the greatest joy! 🐶
